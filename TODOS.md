# TO-DO's

1. Make Vizulalization to see the overlayed images, if limiting the to a shape of 100x100x3 makes land images and house images distinguish from each other.
2. If the above logic makes sense then build an inception model with input as 96x96x3 and compare overlayed images with assessor images
3. Increase the batch size to 128, and see if the CPU is able to handle it or not.
4. Run a model and see statistics for both the assessor images and overlayed images
